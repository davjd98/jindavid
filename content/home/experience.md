  description = """Laminar chaos is a newly discovered chaotic behavior theoretically predicted in 2018, which can be characterizedby steady-state phases separated by short and irregular burst-like transitions. The Mackey-Glass model, developed tosimulate the physiological mechanism of red blood cells, is a common time-delay system that can yield a wide range of periodic and chaotic dynamics. We observed laminar chaos in an electronic Mackey-Glassfeedback circuit, the first of its kind, implemented with an Arduino board to produce variable time delays."""

  description = """The purpose of this investigation is to examine the effects of gaps in nonlinear time series and to observe under which conditions the gaps cause a meaningful difference in analysis. We introduced gaps into two canonical nonlinear systems and gathered data on the conditions under which the correlation dimension of the gapped data diverged from the published value. The limits of reliability were characterized as a function of gap distribution and size."""
